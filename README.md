# HC3-Bank-UI
A basic Bank ATM UI design.

TODO:

1) Design UI

2) Display account amounts on screen

3) Create confirmation and success screens (references already exist in the code - the GUI elements just need to be created and named appropriately (drag, drop, name). 

4) Login functionality

5) Back button and Logout button
